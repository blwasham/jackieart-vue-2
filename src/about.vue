        Growing up a stone’s throw from the Potomac River, Jacquelyn spent many of her days enjoying the river’s beauty. Stemming from those childhood impressions,she uses water and nature as constant subjects in her artwork which is painted mostly in oil, pastel, and watercolor. The artist prefersto demonstrate her subject matter through plein-air painting, where she can observe the intriguing nuances of nature and create a spiritual connection with her environment. Many of her works are completed on site in the Washington area, the Eastern Shore and Southern Maryland. Her paintings attempt to display in canvassed form the peace and stillness of nature trapped within the frantic pace of today’s society. Jacquelyn wants to capture and record a point in time that has moved her spirit, bring that interval to her viewers, and relive that moment with all those who observe her art.
